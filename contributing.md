## How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions in GitHub Issuse. But if you want to get involved more deeply, you can start working on bugs or features defined in [this project's Issues tab](https://github.com/ScottLilly/SOSCSRPG/issues).

### Bugs and feature requests?

For bugs or feature requests, [log a new work item](https://github.com/ScottLilly/SOSCSRPG/issues/new/choose) in this project.

### Contributing code and content

SOSCSRPG accept fixes and features! Here is what you should do when writing code:

* Follow the coding conventions detailed in the [coding standards](https://github.com/ScottLilly/SOSCSRPG/wiki/CodingStandards).
* Add, remove, or delete unit tests to cover your changes. Make sure tests are specific to the changes you are making. Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
* All code changes should be done in your separate branch.
    * Please build your branch from, and submit your pull requests to, the "development" branch
* Any code or documentation you share with this project falls under [the project's license agreement](https://github.com/ScottLilly/SOSCSRPG/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Identifying the scale

If you would like to contribute to the project repositories, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute. If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working on a fix. If you are submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the us first.

All code submissions will be reviewed and tested, and only those that meet the quality bar will be merged into the main branch.

### Submitting a pull request

If you don't know what a pull request is, please read this article: [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and coding conventions.
